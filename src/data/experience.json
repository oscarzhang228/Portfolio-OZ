    "description": "I built from scratch the frontend interface for the Skyview System which was a digital clone that hangar owners could use to prevent ground damages to aircraft. This was a real-time application built in Unity and C# that required high-performance and precision (<= 10ms latency and 2cm distance errors). I also worked on an automatic plane scheduling application that used the Skyview System to track incoming planes.",
