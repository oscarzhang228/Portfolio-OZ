I worked on the backend and front-end of their web application for managers to oversee scheduling, template hangars, and account/billing details. I also worked on the iOS application for crew moving planes to be able to see the created templates as well as for near-collision alarms when moving too close to another plane. This application utilized Unity to be able to simulate the hangar in 3D space as well as track collisions.",
